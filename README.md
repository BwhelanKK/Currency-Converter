# Currency Converter

The currency converter was created as a simple converter that would give the user a quick and easy way of checking curency conversation rates for a specified amount.  It is the starting point of a project I will continue to work on and add more features.

## Design

I wanted to make this as simple as possible.  I created a wireframe to visualise how it would look and to ensure that everything was accessable:

There are no navigation or other utilities, just a simple screen that has all the essentials.  I added a refresh button to provide the user with a clean, simple way to enter another conversion.

## Features Left to Implement

The currencies were included as a mockup to highlight how it works.  I would like to include a currency API that would update the full range of currencies with current rates.

## Testing 

This has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera.
